              <h3>Winemaking Tradition</h3>
              <h2>Our History</h2>
              <p>
                The village of Sakobo in the Signagi district belongs to the Tibaani winemaking zone, located in the inner region of Kakheti, in the eastern part of the Alazani Valley, on the southeastern plain of Gombori, at coordinates 41¬∞35' and 46¬∞00'. The absolute elevation of the viticulture zone ranges from 350 to 550 meters above sea level.

The Bakashvili family has lived in Tibaani since the 18th century. Like almost every family in the area, they have maintained a Marani (traditional Georgian winery) for as long as they can remember. The Marani‚Äîoften referred to as "Marani/home" by locals‚Äîconnects the bedroom directly to the wine cellar with a single door, symbolizing the central role of winemaking in the family‚Äôs daily life.

Ako Bakashvili, who runs the family business, is a financier by profession. However, his love for family heritage...

              <h2>Our History</h2>
              <p>
                The village of Sakobo in the Signagi district belongs to the Tibaani winemaking zone, located in the inner region of Kakheti, in the eastern part of the Alazani Valley, on the southeastern plain of Gombori, at coordinates 41¬∞35' and 46¬∞00'. The absolute elevation of the viticulture zone ranges from 350 to 550 meters above sea level.

The Bakashvili family has lived in Tibaani since the 18th century. Like almost every family in the area, they have maintained a Marani (traditional Georgian winery) for as long as they can remember. The Marani‚Äîoften referred to as "Marani/home" by locals‚Äîconnects the bedroom directly to the wine cellar with a single door, symbolizing the central role of winemaking in the family‚Äôs daily life.

Ako Bakashvili, who runs the family business, is a financier by profession. However, his love for family heritage and a touch of luck brought him back to winemaking. In 2014, together with his father, Ako decided to revive the family tradition of producing wine in Qvevri. At first, it was merely a hobby, meant for family and friends. But after a wine expert, by chance, tasted the wine at a gathering and recognized its potential, Ako was encouraged to take his winemaking to another level and commercialize it.

Not long after, in 2016, Bakashvili Wine made its first official appearance at the Tbilisi Wine Festival, where it received tremendous recognition. This success gave Ako the motivation to continue improving and expanding the family business.

Around the same time, Ako‚Äôs brother‚Äôs painting, The Sommelier, was stolen from an art gallery in Moscow. The only remaining low-quality photograph of the artwork later inspired Ako to use it as the wine label, turning it into a tribute to his brother‚Äôs art.

Today, Bakashvili Winery produces Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Khikhvi, Saperavi, Malbec, and a Cabernet Franc blend‚Äînatural wines crafted with minimal human intervention, following ancient Georgian Qvevri traditions. Annual production is limited to 4000‚Äì5,000 bottles.

Bakashvili wines, easily recognized by their unique label, can now be found in select specialized wine shops in Georgia, Germany, and Austria.

                  At Bakashvili Winery, every bottle begins with a deep respect
                  for our land, our vines, and our family tradition. We are
                  located in the heart of Kakheti, where the soils, sunlight and
                  cool breezes of the Alazani Valley create ideal conditions for
                  healthy, expressive grapes. From the very beginning, our aim
                  has been to produce wines that honestly reflect this unique
                  environment and the centuries-old knowledge of our ancestors.
                  Our approach is rooted in the ancient Qvevri method ‚Äì a
                  winemaking tradition recognized by UNESCO as part of the
                  world‚Äôs intangible cultural heritage. Grapes are harvested by
                  hand from small, carefully tended plots in the Tibaani zone to
                  ensure only the best fruit enters the cellar. Picking by hand
                  allows us to select bunches at optimal ripeness and handle
                  them gently, preserving the natural bloom of wild yeasts on
                  the skins.

                fermenter and aging vessel, maintaining a stable temperature and
                creating a natural micro-oxygenation that shapes the character
                of the wine. Fermentation begins spontaneously with the native
                yeasts present on the grapes; we do not add cultured yeasts or
                chemical additives. This is how our ancestors made wine, and we
                continue the practice to capture the truest expression of the
                fruit. During the long fermentation, the wine is carefully
                watched and stirred by hand to integrate flavors and ensure
                balance. Once fermentation finishes, the wine remains in Qvevri
                for an extended maceration and aging period. This slow, patient
                process allows tannins to soften, aromas to deepen and the wine
                to develop its signature texture and complexity. The clay itself
                imparts subtle earth notes and a gentle roundness, linking each
                bottle to the soil of Tibaani. When the time is right, the wine
                is drawn off the sediment and moved to stainless steel or glass
                for final settling. We bottle everything ourselves in small
                batches, using minimal filtration to keep the wine ‚Äúalive‚Äù and
                vibrant. Each step ‚Äì from vineyard to cellar to label ‚Äì is done
                by our family with care and attention, so that what you taste is
                the genuine result of nature and tradition working together. The
                result is a collection of natural wines ‚Äì Rkatsiteli, Kisi,
                Khikhvi and Saperavi ‚Äì that embody both the ancient Qvevri
                tradition and the personal touch of our family. Limited
                production, usually between 4,000 and 5,000 bottles a year,
                ensures that every bottle receives the same dedication. Our
                wines carry not only the flavor of our grapes but also our
                story, our heritage and our belief that wine is not just a
                drink, but a living connection between people, place and time.
